# frappe_dwf

This repository folder contains a minimal Frappe app scaffold and DocType JSON definitions to implement the IHE Departmental Workflow model.

The DocTypes map IHE actors/transactions/documents to Frappe primitives. The term "DICOM UPS" (Unified Procedure Step) is used in place of the earlier "GP-PPS".
